def ask_overwrite(file_path):
    """
        Asks the user if they wish to overwrite an existing file.

        This function prompts the user with a message indicating that the file specified by
        `file_path` already exists and asks if they want to overwrite it. The user's response is
        expected to be 'y' (yes) or 'n' (no), although any input is accepted and processed.

        Parameters:
        - file_path (str): The path of the file that might be overwritten.

        Returns:
        - bool: True if the user responds with 'y', indicating they want to overwrite the file.
                False for any other response, indicating the user does not want to overwrite the file.

        The user's response is stripped of leading and trailing whitespace and converted to lowercase
        to ensure consistent interpretation regardless of case or accidental space inclusion.
